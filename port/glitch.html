      <p style="font-size:160%;text-align:center">Long before ads were commonplace on Google it was predicted that Google would have to transition to a subscription based model where users would need to pay to access Google services. With google serving us ads based on our internet history we don’t have to pay to use google but we also unknowingly sold parts for our internet privacy to get this point. </p>

      <p style="font-size:160%; text-align:center">Here I created a piece to illustrate how my fascination with Apple as a company has changed over time. Being a child when the first Iphone was announced Apple had cemented themselves as a company of Innovation and elegant design. However, over time after learning about the work culture around Steve Jobs and later Apple's monopolistic behavior under Tim Cook the pedestal on which I viewed Apple slowly started to crumble and was replaced by the reality of what the company really is: A machine designed to squeeze out profit without regard for their customers or the environment. </p>

      <p style="font-size:160%;text-align:center;">Amazon had its humble beginnings in selling books on the internet but now has become the number one site for shopping on the internet with its sheer convenience. Now that amazon has become so big it has the ability to dictate what gets sold on its platform by dictating who is featured in its search results. Not only is it’s search algorithm biased in who it features but it also copies the products that are selling well and sells similar versions at lower rates to price their new competitors out. </p>
