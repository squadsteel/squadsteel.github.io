      <p style="font-size:160%; text-align:center">Here I created a piece to illustrate how my fascination with Apple as a company has changed over time. Being a child when the first Iphone was announced Apple had cemented themselves as a company of Innovation and elegant design. However, over time after learning about the work culture around Steve Jobs and later Apple's monopolistic behavior under Tim Cook the pedestal on which I viewed Apple slowly started to crumble and was replaced by the reality of what the company really is: A machine designed to squeeze out profit without regard for their customers or the environment. </p>

Now that amazon has become so big it has the ability to dictate what gets sold on its platform by dictating who is featured in its search results. Not only is itâ€™s search algorithm biased in who it features but it also copies the products that are selling well and sells similar versions at lower rates to price their new competitors out. </p>
